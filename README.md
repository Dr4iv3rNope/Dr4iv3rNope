## Hi! my name is Dr4iv3rNope.
I'm a programmer with decent amount of knowledge in Rust, C#, Lua, C++ (most familliar with reverse-engineering projects and cheating software). I work on both Windows and Linux, and had experience using ImGui, Minhook and SourceSDK.

Currently, I'm interested in:

- âš¡ Learning WINAPI internals;
- âš¡ Programming for desktop Linux;
- ðŸ”­ Low-level reverse engineering.
- ðŸ˜„ Feel free to reach out if you're interested in exploiting game engines for fun or just texting :3
